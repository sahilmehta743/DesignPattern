# DesignPatterns


## According to the Gang Of Four (GoF), design patterns can be classified into three types

### Creational
Abstract Factory : provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes

### Structural
Proxy : With this pattern, we create an intermediary that acts as an interface to another resource, e.g., a file, a connection.

Decorator : This pattern is useful for enhancing the behavior of an object.

Adapter : The Adapter pattern is used for connecting two incompatible interfaces that otherwise cannot be connected directly.

Bridge : The Bridge pattern is used to decouple an abstraction from its implementation.
